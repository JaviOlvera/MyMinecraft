# My Recreation of Minecraft
### By Javier Olvera Calder√≥n

Recreating Minecraft is a common challenge between programmers, but I tried recreating it from scratch, by creating my own graphics engine, physics engine, procedural world generation, mobs AI...

<br>

üñ•Ô∏è I'm using Visual Studio 2019 with C++ to code the whole project.

<br>

‚òÄÔ∏è The graphics engine is based on **OpenGL** library 
<br>
üçÉ The physics engine has been made by me completely from scratch

<br>

The goal of this proyect is not to COPY Minecraft and publish it as my own game. This is just a learning adventure to see how far can I get in this challenge.

<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è *NOTE:* the project NEEDS a folder called *res* to work propertly. It is missing in the repository because all its content was original minecraft files (textures, audio...), so I decided not to include it in the git repository.
